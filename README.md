# Azure-Functions-Configuration
Documentation and sample code for how to leverage dependency injection for configuration in Azure Functions.

> Note that the application does not actually do anything. It simply shows you how you can leverage dependency injection in your Azure Function applications to handle configuration information and access that information in a strongly typed fashion.

## Documentation
The documentation is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MikaBerglund/Azure-Functions-Configuration/wiki) for this repo. Also check out the [local.settings.json](FunctionApplication/local.settings.json.md) documentation for how to configure the application for local debugging.
