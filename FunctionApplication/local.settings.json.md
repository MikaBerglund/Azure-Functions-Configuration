`local.settings.json` Configuration File
===========================================

In order to be able to run this application locally, you need to have a `local.settings.json` file in the same directory as this documentation file. Configuration files are normally excluded from source control to prevent you from committing sensitive data to the source repository.

You can copy the contents of that file from the [documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/MikaBerglund/Azure-Functions-Configuration/wiki/Local-Configuration#the-full-localsettingsjson-file) for this repository.
